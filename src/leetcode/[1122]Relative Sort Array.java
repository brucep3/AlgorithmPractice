class RelativeSortArray {


}

//Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct, and all ele
//ments in arr2 are also in arr1.
//
// Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1 ar
//e the same as in arr2. Elements that don't appear in arr2 should be placed at th
//e end of arr1 in ascending order.
//
//
// Example 1:
// Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
//Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
//
//
// Constraints:
//
//
// arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000
// 0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000
// Each arr2[i] is distinct.
// Each arr2[i] is in arr1.
